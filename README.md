# React Interview Project
This is a small project for a react interview.

## Goal
Create a React application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI
Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations

## Retrieving data
To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project
Up to you, we recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bonus (not a must)
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Some sort of Integration Test
* Having a nice UI using a components library (Bootstrap?)
* Divide the application in different pages and use a router
* Adding state management
